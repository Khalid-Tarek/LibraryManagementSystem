# LibraryManagmentSystem
This is a simple java library system that was made by The RAD Squad for Software Engineering (2) Final Project.

## Requirements
To be able to make this app to work on your pc you must:
  * Have Microsoft SQL Server 12.0 or higher installed on your pc.
  * Have a database called LibraryDatabase (can be renamed by changing the name in source code) with the specified requirements in the documentation.

## Purpose
This program was created just for us to practice how to create a program using some software engineering practices (documentation, SDLC application, testing, and so on). It wasn't intended to be a software product to be used by an actual library (or it maybe, who knows), and it wasn't created for this purpose.
